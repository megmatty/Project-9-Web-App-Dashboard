# Project-9-Web App Dashboard
Treehouse Project 9
----
This is my ninth project for Treehouse Techdegree: Front End Developer.

**Project Notes:**
* Validated HTML, CSS validates with allowed errors for fill property for svgs.
* Tested on a Mac with Safari 9.1.1 (11601.6.17), Chrome 51.0.2704.63, Firefox 46.0.1
* Attempted to hit all exceeds criteria
  * First time using jQuery-UI, this time for autocomplete functions - had to install jQuery Migrate to get it to work with jQuery 3.0
  * Also first time using local stoage as well
* Charts.js proved to be less customizable than I hoped but I styled the charts to the mockup as best I could
* Linked the settings nav icon to the settings area of the page just because

**Needs Work, Need to Learn, and Thoughts:**
* Charts.js was a very deep library that required a lot of fiddling, but it's impressive in what it can accomplish
* I'm still learning JS so something vanilla JS is easier for me to understand, and other times using jQuery makes more sense. I
  have tried to comment where I used each and why. For example, at my developmental level, it's easier to use "document.getElementById"
  because it provides a more direct cue for my brain as to what it does. But for some things like forEach loops, jQuery is the hands
  down winner for ease of structuring the code block so it does what I want. In time, as I get more skilled, I think it will be easier to
  write in solely one or the other.
* This project had a massive amount of requirements, and it took a lot more organization than any project to date to try to hit every
  single one. Even if I missed something on the first pass, I feel very proud of what I was able to do on this assignment.

~Time to complete: 2 weeks, 4 days. There was an enormous amount of time for research here, from using Charts.js to local storage to
  CSS switches and more.
